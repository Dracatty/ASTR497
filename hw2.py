#Challenge
#1. Examine the headers of the first and second HDU in the point source catalog and try adding new keywords to them or changing them
#2. Make a histogram of the G-band magnitude of the sources in the catalog - can you figure out what the upper limit for Gmag was when the table was selected?
#3. Make a plot of the position of the sources on the sky in the point source catalog, in Galactic coordinates l and b (you will need to use what we learned about SkyCoord in the previous tutorial)
#4. Try and produce a new FITS file that contains the image in the primary HDU and the above table in the second HDU
